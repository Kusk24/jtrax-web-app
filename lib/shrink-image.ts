/**
 * A phone photo, made small enough to upload before an ID card is read.
 *
 * A camera's photo of a card is 2–5 MB and around 4000 px across; reading the
 * card needs a fraction of that. Sent whole it was slow on a phone's
 * connection and larger than the web server in front of the API accepts by
 * default (nginx: 1 MB), so the scan failed before it reached the reader and
 * the form could only say it could not read the card. Scaled to 1600 px on
 * its longest side it is a few hundred kilobytes and still sharp enough to
 * read.
 *
 * Anything that goes wrong — a format the browser cannot decode, no canvas —
 * hands back the original file, which is what was sent before.
